# VC-Forever-Discord

**Support**
If you need any help regarding to the following, feel free to ask it to me! I may not reply in DMs so you may have to ask in the [server](https://discord.gg/darkdomain) itself

**Set Up**
Following script is made specially for begginers, so I would prefer you to use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~) for hosting.
1. Head over to Index.js and change the channel which bot has to join when on.
2. Head over to Secret Environment Variables(ENV) and make a new secret, key `token` and in value, enter your bot token, got from discord developer [Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
3. You can also change the Twitch Streaming URL in Index.js
4. Lastly Hit run!

**Errors**
Main error while running the bot would be the VC joining, inorder to fix that make sure you have right permissions for the bot.
1. If the bot says cannot connect to the channel, then give the bot ADMINISTRATOR permissions and try.
2. If there is run button configuration problem, then reload the page and enter `node.js` in language and `npm start` below
